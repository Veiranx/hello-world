# hello-world
This is my first repository aimed at helping me learn how to develop custom Android ROMs

It may end up taking a long time, but I'm hoping to learn perseverance and patience while attempting to complete this project. If all goes well, the Umidigi F1 will have a custom ROM built by me.
